> The interface to a **software library** is one type of API. The API describes and prescribes the
> "expected behavior" (a specification) while the library is an "actual implementation" of this set
> of rules.

> An API can specify the interface between an application and the **operating system.** POSIX, for
> example, specifies a set of common APIs that aim to enable an application written for a POSIX
> conformant operating system to be compiled for another POSIX conformant operating system.
