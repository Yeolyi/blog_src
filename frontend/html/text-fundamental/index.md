- Preferably, you should use a single <h1> per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.
- Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use <h3> elements to represent subheadings, followed by <h2> elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.
- Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use **no more than three per page**, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.

Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings.

This is a <span> element. It has no semantics. You use it to wrap content when you want to apply CSS to it (or do something to it with JavaScript) without giving it any extra meaning.

You shouldn't use <em> purely to get italic styling. To do that, you'd use a <span> element and some CSS, or perhaps an <i> element.

It's only appropriate to use <b>, <i>, or <u> to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed with bold, italics, or underline when there isn't a more suitable element; and there usually is??

People strongly associate underlining with hyperlinks. Therefore, on the web, it's best to only underline links.
