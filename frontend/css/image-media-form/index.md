### Replaced elements

> Images and video are described as **replaced elements**. This means that CSS
> cannot affect the internal layout of these elements â€” only their position on
> the page amongst other elements.

### Sizing images

> When using object-fit the replaced element can be sized to fit a box in a
> variety of ways.

### Replaced elements in layout

Replaced elements, when they become part of a grid or flex layout, have
different default behaviors, essentially to avoid them being stretched strangely
by the layout.

### Form elements
