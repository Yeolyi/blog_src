title: CSS values and units

### What is a CSS value?

> A value type in CSS is a way to define a collection of allowable values.

### Numbers, lengths, and percentages

> **Absolute length units** are not relative to anything else, and are generally considered to always be the same size.

> **Relative length units** are relative to something else, perhaps the size of the parent element's font, or the size of the viewport. 

em and rem are the two relative lengths you are likely to encounter most frequently when sizing anything from boxes to text. 

If you set an element's font-size as a percentage, it will be a percentage of the font-size of the element's parent.
