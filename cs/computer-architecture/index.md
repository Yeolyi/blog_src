## MIT 6.004

> This course introduces architecture of digital systems, emphasizing structural principles common to a wide range of technologies. It covers the topics including multilevel implementation strategies, definition of new primitives (e.g., gates, instructions, procedures, processes) and their mechanization using lower-level elements. It also includes analysis of potential concurrency, precedence constraints and performance measures, pipelined and multidimensional systems, instruction set design issues and architectural support for contemporary software structures.
